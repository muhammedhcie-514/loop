4.2.1 Comparison Operations in a Playbook
Example: Print all the IP addresses of the controlled host client-1.
Write a playbook as follows:
- hosts: all
 gather_facts: true
 tasks:
 - debug:
 msg: ip address of Client-1 is "{{ ansible_all_ipv4_addresses }}"
 when: ansible_hostname == "client-1"
Execute the playbook. The following information is displayed.
ansible-playbook ip.yml

4.2.2 Logical Operation in a Playbook
Example: Print all the IP addresses of the controlled host client-1 with Ansible 2.9.27
used.
Write a playbook as follows:
- hosts: all
 gather_facts: true
 tasks:
 - debug:
 msg: ip address of Client-1 is "{{ ansible_all_ipv4_addresses }}"
 when: ansible_hostname == "client-1" and ansible_version.full == "2.9.27"
Execute the playbook. The following information is displayed.
ansible-playbook ip2.yml

4.2.3 Path Determination in a Playbook
Example: Copy the /home/test file of the controller to the controlled host.
Write a playbook as follows:
- hosts: all
 gather_facts: true
 tasks:
 - name: create a file
 copy:
 src: /home/test
 dest: /home/test
 when: "'/home/test' is exists"




Execute the playbook is executed. The following information is displayed.

ansible-playbook test.yml

Create a /home/test directory on the controller.
[root@controller yaml]# touch /home/test
[root@controller yaml]# ls /home
openeuler test

ansible-playbook test.yml


4.2.4 Task Execution Result Determination in a Playbook
Example: Create a /tmp/test file on the controller. If the file is successfully created, the
message "mission is success" is displayed.
Write a playbook as follows:
- hosts: all
 gather_facts: true
 tasks:
 - name: create a file
 copy:
 src: /home/test/
 dest: /home/test/
 register: returnmsg
 - name: result
 debug:
 msg: "mission is success"
 when: "returnmsg is success"

ansible-playbook test1.yml

⚫ Question: If the condition is changed to when: "returnmsg is changed", can the
message "mission is success" be returned?
⚫ Answer: No. The file has been created in a previous section. Therefore, the changed
condition cannot be met. The execution result is as follows.



4.2.5 Usage of Block
Example 1: Install httpd on the controlled host client-1 and disable the firewalld service.
Write a playbook as follows:
- hosts: all
 gather_facts: true
 tasks:
 - block:
 - name: install httpd
 yum:
 name: httpd
 state: present
 - name: stop firewalld
 service:
 name: firewalld
 state: stopped
 when: ansible_hostname == "client-1"
Execute the playbook. The following information is displayed.
ansible-playbook httpd.yml


Example 2: Install httpd-test on the controlled host client-1 and disable the firewalld
service. If the installation fails, the message "installation is faild" is displayed.
Write a playbook as follows:
- hosts: all
 gather_facts: true
 tasks:
 - block:
 - name: install httpd
 yum:
 name: httpd-test
 state: present
 rescue:
 - debug:
 msg: "installation is faild"
 always:
 - name: stop firewalld
 service:
 name: firewalld
 state: stopped
 when: ansible_hostname == "client-1"
Execute the playbook. The following information is displayed.
ansible-playbook httpd.yml
